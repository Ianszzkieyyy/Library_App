# Library_App

Hello, this is a library app I created after taking a five month break from coding. As I work on this project, I also refreshed
on my web development fundamentals.

## Flow of App

- The app will ask the user its name along with the type of books he/she enjoys the most. This is to modify UI based off preferences.
- On the main menu, there is a little form that can be used to add books.
- (OPTIONAL) add filters based on alphabetical order, filter read or not read etc.
