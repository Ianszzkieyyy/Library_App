# Library_App

Hello, this is a library app I created after taking a five month break from coding. As I work on this project, I also refreshed
on my web development fundamentals.

## Flow of App

- The app will ask the user its name along with the type of books he/she enjoys the most. This is to modify UI based off preferences.
- On the main menu, there is a little form that can be used to add books.
- (OPTIONAL) add filters based on alphabetical order, filter read or not read etc.

## 05/20/22 UPDATE
- I have finished creating the app. The only thing I added was the key features. All features not added will be added later. For now, I just wanted to 
get coding reps in and do my best to create a working and functioning app, albeit not the best written code. :)

- Current limitations include; currently non-responsive, ugly UI design, nav links don't have any content.
